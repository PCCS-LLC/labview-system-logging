# LabVIEW System.Logging

**LabVIEW System.Logging** is an open-source utility and extension framework designed to enhance the developer experience while debugging in the LabVIEW IDE.

## IT HAS A CONSOLE
That's right a console! printf, console.writline, console.log - your terminal dreams now available in LabVIEW!

## OTHER COOL STUFF
- **Unified Interface:** Logging is handled through a single, consistent set of api functions, simplifying the integration of logging into your LabVIEW projects.
- **Dependency Zero:** Default providers only require LabVIEW Base, allowing for easy application to small or legacy projects. 
- **Severity Support:** Filter through the noise with severity configurations within log providers.
- **Extensible Providers:** The framework is released with two initial providers, "console" and "json". Itâ€™s designed to support the addition of new providers, enabling flexibility to integrate various logging utilities.
- **Scalability:** More providers will be added to the project over time, allowing continuous enhancement of logging capabilities.

## Installation
